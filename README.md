# Remote Elderly Monitoring IoT Project
We created an Internet of Things based prototype to connect medical sensors to an MQTT broker, analyze received data to classify an emergency situation, and then forward it to a RESTful API. In turn, a remote browser-based dashboard application could request and visualize the data using various graphs and widgets
